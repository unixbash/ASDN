# ASDN - Automated Software Defined Networking

## Introduction

The project being developed is a network automation platform which will initially aid and eventually replace network engineers in configuring and making changes on a live network. This will subsequently reduce operating costs as well as the possibility of human introduced errors. The devices this platform will communicate with include, but are not limited to switches, routers and firewalls. These are not consumer, but industry grade networking appliances, ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of euro in value.


## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

> The installation instructions are low priority in the readme and should come at the bottom. The first part answers all their objections and now that they want to use it, show them how.
