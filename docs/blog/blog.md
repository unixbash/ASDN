### Initial Project Planning (01/10/17)

This is my first blog entry I wil briefly outline the progress I have made thus far:
  - Researched the areas the project will most affect (Computer Networking & Assisted Machine Learning)
  - Met with my potential project supervisor Mr. Brian Stone
  - Developed and submitted my Project Proposal Form
  - Carried out further research on scripting platforms such as Ansible and Puppet.
  - Crated a simple System Design Diagram
